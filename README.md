# temperature_dataset_exploration
##### This notebook uses temperature dataset by Jason Brownlee which explores how the temperature of a place changes with time and other factors. The model uses rnn and lstm along with conv 1-d layer for prediction.
###### I learned all this code from Tensorflow in practice specialisation by DeepLearning.ai at coursera.
###### After going through the playlist I was able to code the same easily.
###### For proper understanding you can also go through my blogs on https://abhishek-parashar.github.io/. I write about Deep Learning, Machine learning, GANs and some random stuff. 
###### Feel free to suggest new topics for blogs or if you find a problem in any of the repositories raise an issue. I would do my best to resolve that at the earliest.
